# SpaceX Satellite Simulator - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The SpaceX Satellite Simulator is built using a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Visualization Engine**: Handles 3D rendering using Three.js
2. **Satellite Network**: Manages satellite positions, connections, and data flow
3. **Ground Station Network**: Manages ground stations and their connections
4. **Data Flow Manager**: Simulates packet routing through the network
5. **User Interface**: React components for controlling the simulation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **Build System**: Webpack
- **Package Management**: npm
- **Styling**: CSS

## Component Breakdown

### Visualization Components

- **Earth**: Renders the Earth with texture mapping
- **SatelliteManager**: Manages satellite visualization and orbital mechanics
- **GroundStationManager**: Manages ground station visualization and positioning
- **DataFlowManager**: Visualizes data packets moving through the network

### Model Components

- **SatelliteNetwork**: Core logic for satellite behavior and connections
- **GroundStationNetwork**: Core logic for ground station behavior and connections

### UI Components

- **SimulationControls**: Controls for adjusting simulation parameters
- **GroundStationPanel**: Interface for interacting with ground stations
- **GroundStationDetails**: Displays detailed information about selected ground stations
- **GroundStationControls**: Controls for modifying ground station parameters

## Data Flow

1. User interactions are captured by React components
2. Control signals are passed to the appropriate managers
3. Network models update their internal state
4. Visualization components reflect the updated state
5. Three.js renders the scene

## Key Algorithms

### Orbital Mechanics

The simulator uses Keplerian orbital mechanics to calculate satellite positions:

1. Satellites are initialized with orbital parameters (altitude, inclination, etc.)
2. Mean anomaly is updated based on elapsed time
3. Mean anomaly is converted to eccentric anomaly using Kepler's equation
4. Eccentric anomaly is converted to true anomaly
5. True anomaly is used to calculate position in orbital plane
6. Position is transformed to Earth-centered inertial frame

### Packet Routing

Data packets are routed through the network using:

1. Geographic routing for packets with known destination coordinates
2. Shortest-path routing for packets to internet destinations
3. Dynamic connection management as satellites move in their orbits

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`

### Adding New Features

#### Adding a New Satellite Type

1. Update the `Satellite` interface in `SatelliteNetwork.ts`
2. Add new type to the initialization logic in `initializeConstellation()`
3. Update the visualization in `SatelliteManager.ts`

#### Adding a New Ground Station

1. Add the station to the `stationLocations` array in `GroundStationNetwork.ts`
2. Update the visualization in `GroundStationManager.ts`

#### Modifying Routing Algorithms

1. Update the `findNextHop()` method in `DataFlowManager.ts`
2. Adjust the routing logic in `SatelliteNetwork.ts`

## Performance Considerations

- The simulation is computationally intensive, especially with many satellites
- Orbital calculations are simplified for performance
- Packet visualization is limited to a subset of all packets
- Three.js rendering is optimized with object pooling

## Future Enhancements

- Add more detailed satellite models
- Implement more sophisticated routing algorithms
- Add weather effects and their impact on signal quality
- Implement user authentication for saving configurations
- Add more detailed analytics and statistics
- Support for mobile devices with touch controls
