# SpaceX Satellite Simulator - User Documentation

## Overview

The SpaceX Satellite Simulator is an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates the flow of data between satellites in the Starlink constellation and ground stations. This simulator provides a realistic representation of satellite orbital mechanics, network topology, and data packet routing through the network.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Interactive Earth model with orbiting satellites and ground stations
- **Realistic Orbital Mechanics**: Satellites follow proper orbital paths based on Kepler's laws
- **Network Topology**: Visualization of connections between satellites and ground stations
- **Data Flow Simulation**: Packet routing through the satellite network with visual representation
- **Ground Station Controls**: Ability to modify ground station parameters and observe effects
- **Simulation Controls**: Adjust simulation speed, pause/resume, and focus on specific elements

## Getting Started

1. Access the simulator at: http://3000-ilg3c3k857oea5apj5424-1246d51f.manus.computer
2. The main view shows Earth with the Starlink satellite constellation orbiting around it
3. Use your mouse to interact with the visualization:
   - Left-click and drag to rotate the view
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Right-click and drag to pan

## Interface Guide

### Main Visualization

The central area displays the 3D visualization of Earth, satellites, ground stations, and data packets. Satellites are represented as small objects with solar panels, ground stations as red towers on Earth's surface, and data packets as colored spheres moving between nodes.

### Simulation Controls

Located at the top of the screen:
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Stops or starts the simulation
- **Simulation Speed Slider**: Adjusts the speed of the simulation from 0.1x to 10x

### Ground Station Panel

Located on the right side of the screen:
- **Ground Station Selection**: Choose a ground station to view or modify
- **Status Control**: Set the operational status of the selected ground station
- **Bandwidth Control**: Adjust the bandwidth capacity of the selected ground station
- **Internet Connection Toggle**: Enable/disable internet connectivity
- **Station Details**: View detailed information about the selected ground station
- **Network Statistics**: Overview of the entire ground station network

## Understanding the Visualization

### Satellites

- Satellites are organized in 9 orbital planes around Earth
- Each satellite has connections to others in the same orbital plane (blue lines)
- V1.5 satellites also have cross-plane connections to satellites in adjacent planes
- Satellites maintain connections to ground stations when in range

### Ground Stations

- Ground stations are positioned at major cities around the world
- Each ground station has a coverage area (faint red circle)
- Ground stations connect to satellites that pass overhead
- Some ground stations provide internet connectivity to the network

### Data Packets

- Data packets are represented as colored spheres
- Color indicates priority:
  - Green: Low priority
  - Yellow: Medium priority
  - Red: High priority
- Size indicates data size (larger = more data)
- Packets follow optimal routes through the network based on destination

## Technical Details

### Orbital Mechanics

The simulator uses simplified Keplerian orbital mechanics to calculate satellite positions. Key parameters include:
- Altitude: ~550km
- Inclination: 53Â° (with slight variations between planes)
- Eccentricity: Near-circular orbits

### Network Routing

Data packets are routed through the network using:
- Geographic routing for packets with known destination coordinates
- Shortest-path routing for packets to internet destinations
- Dynamic connection management as satellites move in their orbits

### Performance Considerations

- The simulation runs entirely in your browser using WebGL
- Performance may vary depending on your hardware
- Reducing the number of visible data packets can improve performance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Try refreshing the page
2. Ensure your browser supports WebGL
3. Check that you have a stable internet connection
4. Try a different browser if problems persist

## About the Project

This SpaceX Satellite Simulator was created to visualize the complex data flow patterns in the Starlink satellite constellation. It provides an educational tool for understanding how satellite networks operate and how data is routed through space-based infrastructure.

The simulation is based on publicly available information about the Starlink network and uses simplified models to represent the actual system.
